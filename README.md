## 💡 Insights & Managerial Actions  

### 🔍 Insights
- **Vegan Salted-Cream Coffee** accounts for **≈30% of total revenue** with **~48% GM** → *this is the hero product.*  
- **Grab delivery** brings 15% of sales but has **10% lower margins** due to platform fees → *adjust pricing or create bundles.*
